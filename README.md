# Literature Catalog of GC System Properties for Dwarf Galaxies

This repository hosts a literature catalog of dwarf galaxy total stellar, peak halo, and GCS masses, with all units in solar masses, as well as total GC counts. This data is taken from the following surveys and literature catalogs: 

 <ul>
  <li>ACS Virgo Cluster Survey - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0330">Peng et al. (2008)</a></li>
  <li>ACS Fornax Cluster Survey - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06909">Liu et al. (2008)</a></li>
  <li>Fornax Deep Survey - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09648">Prole et al. (2019)</a></li>
  <li>ELVES Survey - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03440">Carlsten et al. (2022)</a></li>
  <li>MATLAS Survey - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03311">Marleau et al. (2024)</a></li>
  <li>Georgiev Catalog - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.2039">Georgiev et al. (2010)</a></li>
  <li>Gannon Catalog - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09104">Gannon et al. (2024)</a></li>
</ul> 

Information about criteria for galaxies to be included in this literature catalog and how GCS masses and peak halo masses were calculated can be found in Dornan & Harris 2025b.
